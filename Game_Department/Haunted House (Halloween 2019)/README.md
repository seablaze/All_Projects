Halloween 2019 -- Oct 26

# Background
For George School class of 21 foundraising, we present this haunted house & zombie escape experience during halloween 2019. Seablaze Studio at Newtown worked with George School Game Design Club(referenced as GS Game Design Club), George School class of 2021 Steering Commitee(referenced as Steering Commitee), George School Film Department(GS Film Department), and all the precious volunteers to bring together this fantastic experience. 

It was the first week of October when Scott Seraydarian, sponsor of GS class of 2021, head of GS Film Department, and sponsor of GS Game Design Club, brough up this idea to the Steering Commitee as a fund raising for prom. Everyone in the Steering Commitee ended up loving this idea. Immediately Scott along with Eric Guo, President of GS Game Design Club and CCO of Seablaze Studio, to present this idea with the GS Game Design Club to start designing the details. Then the Steering Commitee gathered numerous precious volunteers to pre-sell tickets during lunch time and to decorate on the event day. Also, Scott led a film crew to create the very exquisitely designed and vividly done opening orientational video. We spent numerous time planning, meeting, and decorating throughout the entire month and especially on the last day! Thanks a lot to everyone who contributed to this project it would not be possible to be as great as it turned out to be without your help
